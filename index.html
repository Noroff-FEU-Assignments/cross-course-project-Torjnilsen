    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[Keep updates up-to-date Avoiding software updates could bring heavy consequences for your website as attackers are quick in finding holes which to get in through and gain control inside. This is exactly why it’s important for you to keep your website’s platform and software updated. And Strengthen your passwords OK, we get it. The phrase “that’s won’t happen to me” is a perfect excuse, but you have to start believing that an attack to your website is always possible, specially if your passwords follow a pretty common pattern. So, when you’re resetting your passwords—which you’ll do right after you’re done read this article, right?—, make sure they’re untraceable by adding a mix of special characters, numbers, and letters. Please, and forget about the “123456”, that is no longer allowed as an excuse. ]</p>
